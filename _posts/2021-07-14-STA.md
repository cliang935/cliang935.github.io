STC: max delay in data path; min delay in clock path  
HTC: min delay in data path; max delay in clock path

How to fix setup violations?

Reduce Tcq, Tpd, Tsu; Increase Tclock

1. **Increase** the drive strength of **data-path** logic gates

2. Use the **data-path** cells with **lesser** threshold voltages *(HVT RVT/SVT LVT)*

3. Improve the **setup** time of **capturing** flip-flop

4. Insert buffer in the **clock** path

5. **Reduce** tcq of **launching** flip-flop

    - Improve transition at flip-flops clock pin  
    - Choose a flip-flop of high drive strength. However, if by doing so, clock transition degrades, delay can actually increase  
    - Replace the flip-flop with a flip-flop of same drive strength, but lower Vth

6. Postive clock skew helps improve the setup slack

    - Increase the clock latency of capturing flip-flop  
    - Decrease the clock latency of launching flip-flop

7. Increase clock period (Reduce frequency of design)

8. Add repeaters

9. Restructuring of the data path

10. Routing topologies

    - less net delay (backend route)  
    - try the net to have as less detouring as possible  
    - Vias increase the net resistance. So, try to have as less vias as possible  
    - Higher metal layers have less resistance. So, long nets can be routed in higher layers to have less net delay

How to fix hold violations?

Increase Tcq, Tpd; Reduce Th

1. **Reduce** the drive strength of **data-path** logic gates

2. Use the **data-path** cells with **higher** threshold voltages *(HVT RVT/SVT LVT)*

3. Improve the **hold** time of **capturing** flip-flop

    - Using a capturing flip-flop with higher drive strength and/or lower threshold voltage  
    - Improving the transition at flip-flop clock pin

4. Insert delay elements(ex. buffer) in the **data** path

5. **Increase** tcq of **launching** flip-flop

    - Decrease the drive strength of the flip-flop  
    - Higher threshold voltage(Vth) of the flip-flop

6. Negative clock skew helps aids hold timing

    - Decrease the clock latency of capturing flip-flop  
    - Increase the clock latency of launching flip-flop

7. Detoured routing
